OpenAI offers API services that allow developers to integrate their AI models into 
their applications, enabling natural language understanding and generation, content 
summarization, and more. An API key is a unique code or token provided to developers, 
typically by a service or platform, that allows them to access and use specific functionalities or 
data from that service through an Application Programming Interface (API). It acts as a secure 
authentication mechanism, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can interact with 
the API.
